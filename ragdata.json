        {"subject_matter": "public_customer_stories","text_chunk": "Shipt, a logistics and delivery company acquired by Target, struggled with their prior postgres database in keeping delivery drivers connected and wanted to avoid unnecessary dependencies and cost to their business that came from using the Twilio platform in their driver sms-based application.  They selected CockroachDB to act as their database for a home-grown replacement for Twilio and found success in both delivering reliable throughput and latency across all the users while also ensuring all data was always consistent.  The biggest immmediate benefit Shipt received from using CockroachDB was the removal of the need to do manual corrections and reconciliations to the data in their system (something they had to do far too often when their previous database failed to synchronize data across regions and even lost data during outages.  Shipt enjoys the zero Recovery Time Objective or (Zero RPO) facilitated by CockroachDB and the cross region deployment it supports.  Shipt also services thousands of stores across North America and benefits from the ability to store data as close to each store as possible, thus reducing latency for updates and reads to and from delivery and inventory tables.  Shipt also values the compatibiility of CRDB with Postgresql: both the ability to use Postgres drivers, and the support of postgres syntax.  Shipt has many engineers with extensive experiennce using Postgres and they found the transition to CRDB to be simple."},
        {"subject_matter": "public_customer_stories","text_chunk": "Hard Rock Digital, the global interactive gaming and sports betting arm of Hard Rock, chose CockroachDB to power its highly regulated online sports betting platform. They needed a database that could handle rapid scale, deliver always-on availability, and meet stringent regulatory requirements for data consistency and disaster recovery. CockroachDB enabled Hard Rock Digital to confidently expand into multiple US states, ensuring compliance with the storage and resilience mandates of each region, while delivering seamless player experiences even during periods of peak betting demand. With CockroachDB, Hard Rock Digital was able to innovate quickly in the competitive gaming sector, all while maintaining maximum uptime and regulatory assurance.  Traditional databases like PostgreSQL (which they used previously for other parts of their stack) imposed limits on vertical scaling, high-availability, and cross-region operations. Scaling user concurrency, transactional load, and state-specific workloads, all while maintaining compliance, was not feasible with their previous architecture."},
