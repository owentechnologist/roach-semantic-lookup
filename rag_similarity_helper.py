## This function enables: 
# The retrieval of chunks of text from a vectorDB based on their relevance to an incoming vectorized prompt
# in addition, it opens up the limiting of access by visibility
# this naive demo always uses public visibility as a filter
# a richer impl would take classification_description as an additional arg to the function

# the query targets a separate table called: llm_enrichment which contains chunked reference/memory text
# the semantic similarity of the prompt is used to fetch additional information that can be used to augment the prompt for an llm  
# they must be <threshold%> semantically similar to be returned
# returns a dictionary containing the content and pk of the
